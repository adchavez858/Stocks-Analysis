# Stocks-Analysis
Performing analysis of stock data to uncover trends
##Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was tp try to improve the efficiency of our stock analysis code by refactoring the VBA code to collect desired stock information from 2017 and 2018 data. The goal is to be able to quickly look at the data and determine which stocks might be wise to invest in. This analysis was completed in our earlier analysis, however we want to make the code run in less time and use less memory. 

### Data
The data reflects 12 different stocks we are tracking, it is displayed in two charts that clearly show the Total daily volume and the total percent return. The total daily volume is taken from the raw data, and the return is calculated by looking at the openiing price and closing price. The code is attempting to collect all useful info and compiling it in one neat area easy to read for any user. 

## Results
Once the code was succesfully implimented, we were able to see that the code retrieved all of the info correctly, and did it faster than the previous code. For 2017 the compile time was 0.09375 seconds, and for 2018 the compile time was 0.078125 seconds as seen below:

## Summary
The goal in refactoring is to make our code run as efficiently as possible, and clean the code up to make it easier for other people to read and follow. Some advantages of a more organized code includes asthetic design, easier to debugging, and faster compile times. Although, we may not always be able to refactor our code due to not having the proper test cases. The most important reason to refactor is to significantly decrease the macro run time. All of these points can be illustrated below:
